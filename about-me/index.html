    <p>
    I was born in <strong>1983</strong>, lived <strong>20</strong> years in <strong>Adana</strong> and I have been living in <strong>Istanbul</strong> since 2004. I started Sakarya University <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> in<strong> 2003</strong> and graduated at<strong> 2007</strong> as the <strong>highest ranking student</strong> of the department.
    </p>

   <p>
   After working 8 years as professional software developer, architect and team leader, I left my job at 31th July 2015 and established my own company: <strong><a href="https://volosoft.com" target="_blank">Volosoft</a></strong>.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   I have been programming since I was <strong>14 </strong>(since <strong>1997</strong>). I started with Turbo Pascal 7.0 and worked on many languages, platforms and technologies so far.
   I especially like developing <strong>multithreaded </strong>and <strong>distributed</strong> software systems, <strong>application frameworks</strong> and <strong>open source</strong> projects.
   </p>

   <p>
   Beside computers, I like reading books, especially science, science-fiction, psychology and detective books. I like to play chess and Turkish checkers.
   </p>

   <h3>My Computer Life</h3>

   <p>
   I met with computer at 13 years old and started programming at 14 (year <strong>1997</strong>) with <strong>Turbo Pascal 7.0</strong>. First motivation that takes me into programming was to code my own games. My computer was not running good games. It was an old computer that has Intel <strong>286</strong> CPU and <strong>MSDOS 6.22</strong> operating system. <strong>Norton Commander 5.0</strong> was my best friend. I built many small games and DOS applications with Pascal. I learned Pascal from a Turkish book and self <strong>help menu</strong> of Turbo Pascal editor. I was looking at all standard library functions from help reference and trying them...
   </p>
   
   <p>
   I interested in web technologies (<strong>Frontpage 98</strong> and a little <strong>HTML</strong>) through a handbook from PcWorld ad but I have not a PC that I can built web sites. By the time I obtained an <strong>Pentium 133</strong> PC (It was also an old PC relative to it’s time) with <strong>Windows 95</strong> OS in the year <strong>2000</strong>. I built my first static <strong>HTML web site</strong> and published to a <strong>free</strong> web host in an <strong>internet cafe</strong>.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   One day in a <strong>PcWorld</strong> magazine ad, I had an handbook about <strong>Perl</strong>. I read it and learned that web is not consist of only static HTML pages. Then I had an <strong>ASP (Active Server Pages) </strong>handbook from PcWorld and <strong>I saw the light</strong>, changed my world! :) It was too hard to make <strong>ASP</strong> running on a <strong>Windows 95</strong> PC. I found <strong>PWS </strong>(<strong>Personal Web Server</strong> that is an old variant of <strong>IIS</strong>) for <strong>Win 98</strong> from web, downloaded hardly and installed. After a week effort it worked! In this one week, I finished reading the <strong>ASP</strong> handbook without coding (or coding in my mind) and I was ready to code! I sit my chair and started coding ASP.  At the same time, I learned that it is not useful to build an ASP web site without a database... I started learning <strong>MS Access</strong> while it is not installed on my PC. I did not give up, designed my database for my new web site on a white paper, found an office PC that has MS Access installed, created my database and copied it to my computer with a 3.5 inch floppy disc. Eventually I build my ASP based web site by using only <strong>ASP</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and Windows <strong>NotePad</strong> and uploaded to a free ASP hosting server.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   In 2001, I started to Cukurova University <strong>Textile Engineering</strong>. I continued programming as an hobby. At the second year I decided to give up Textile, prepared university exams again and won the Sakarya University <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>. Since I love computers and programming, my lectures was pretty good and I graduated as the <strong>highest ranking student </strong>of the department (<strong>3.55</strong> of 4.00).
   </p>
   
   <p>
   In university first class, I learned <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Visual Basic.NET</strong> and <strong>ASP.NET</strong>. In the second year I entered to <strong>IT</strong> department of university to build a completely new Student Relations Automation System. I worked there for one year, finished project and learned <strong>Visual Basic.NET</strong> (With <strong>Visual Studio 2003</strong>) and <strong>SQL Server 2000</strong> deeply.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   In the third year of university (year 2005) I learned <strong>C++ </strong>from the ultimate book of Robert Lafore: <strong>Object Oriented Programming in C++</strong>. This was my first introducing with <strong>object oriented programming</strong>. I was impressed! After C++, it was really easy to learn <strong>C#</strong> (since I was already familiar with .NET through I know VB.NET).
   </p>
   
   <p>
   At the second half of third class, I joined the <strong>Erasmus </strong>program and studied in <strong>Thessaly University</strong> of <strong>Greece</strong>. It was my first abroad experience and was very helpful for me.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   At the fourth class of university I get my final project as "<strong>TCP/IP stack implementation in Java</strong>". I was not a good knowledge on <strong>Java </strong>or <strong>TCP/IP</strong>. In the first term, I deeply learned Java (From the book "<strong>Java, The Complete Reference</strong>" by Herbert Schildt) and researched on TCP/IP protocol suite. In the last term I implemented <strong>ARP</strong>, <strong>IP</strong> and <strong>TCP</strong> (TCP is not finished completely because of time restriction). I accomplished to build an application that communucates over internet not using default Windows TCP/IP stack (sockets) but using my own TCP/IP stack. I also have written an article and developed an application over <strong>ARP spoofing</strong>. I also improved my skills on <strong>multithread and asynchronous programming</strong>.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   After graduating university in <strong>2007</strong>, I worked two different companies and finally working for my own company. I developed many Windows and web based applications/services using primarly <strong>C# and .NET platform</strong>. In the business life I learned many other technologies and methods.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   I especially like to develop <strong>good designed, object oriented, multithreaded</strong> and <strong>distributed</strong> software systems. As like a computer without internet is not useful and powerful, I think that an application is not powerful without communicating to other applications and systems.
